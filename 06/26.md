I realize that I need to change something: 

```js
this.props.fetchUser(this.props.match.params.userId)
    .then(() => this.setState({
        posts: this.props.users[this.props.match.params.userId].posts 
    }))
```

The code above is executing EVERY SINGLE TIME a user toggles between the `profile.jsx` component and the `profile_activity.jsx` component. That's not good, since presumably all the information about the user is kept when I navigate to the user's profile for the first time (don't need to keep fetching). 

So what I'll need to do is to somehow PREVENT the fetchUser from happening on the componentDidMount for the `profile.jsx` component IF the previous history already had profile in it....interesting.
